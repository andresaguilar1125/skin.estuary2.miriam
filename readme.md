# Skin Estuary MOD V2 for KODI 21 Omega KN Edition #

It's strongly recommended to install the skin via the "Kodinerds Repo", as this is the only way to guarantee that additional 
required modules (e.g. the PVR Artwork Module) are also installed. Another advantage is that you get automatic updates when 
you install an addon from a repository and not from ZIP.

To install the Kodinerds repository visit the page "https://repo.kodinerds.net", download the repository zip (red button) 
and install it. After that you can install the skin directly from the repository under "Look & Feel", "Skins".
